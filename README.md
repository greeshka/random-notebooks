# random-notebooks

This is a repository with some of my analytical Jupyter Notebooks I find funny or interesting. 

## DoctorWhoRating.ipynb

Doctor Who is a famous British series, in which actors playing the main character, The Doctor, are changing every few seasons. I had a feeling that recent Doctors are worse than before so it was interesting to see if other people think the same way. <br><br>
In this notebook I parse Appreciation Index for episodes from Wikipedia with wikipedia package, merge them into single DataFrame and then plot with different color for different Doctors. Parsing was a little tricky, because tables on Wikipedia have different headers, so I had to rename some columns. The final plot is inserted with screenshot, because github doesn't support plotly plots, the code to build the plot is commented above. <br><br>
I didn't do any math here, but I think it is seen from the plot that people like episodes with 12th and 13th Doctor less, than with 10th and 11th.



## SOME_COMPANY_1_test_problems.ipynb

This notebook contains my test problems for SOME_COMPANY_1 (all comments are in russian). Here I had to solve some theoretical problems and then do a little research on stock prices change. <br><br>
I calculated difference in closing prices and tried to match its distribution with some known distributions with visual (matplotlib) and math methods (scipy, statsmodels).
